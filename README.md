Creating a Duck Hunt Controller to Allow Players to utilize immersion and play as the duck.

The controller is in a rough duck-like shape, players hold the body of the duck with the head facing forward and the wings out to either side.

The wings can be pressed with your thumbs and act as left and right movement buttons for the duck within the game.

The wiring will come out the back of the duck body and plug into a laptop or PC as to not get in the way of the authentic duck experience.

On the underside of the duck there are two holes for index finger buttons that will allow for new duck abilities which are to go invisable briefly and to send a fake duck to distract the hunter.

The duck will feature a breadboard, an ardiuno, a vibration motor at the base of the neck, and four buttons total (2 wings, 2 abilities).

The first thing I would do if I had more time would be to change the body to more of a cylindrical shape, I believe that would be more comfortable to hold but even rounding the edges more would go a long way in making the player believe they are holding a duck.
